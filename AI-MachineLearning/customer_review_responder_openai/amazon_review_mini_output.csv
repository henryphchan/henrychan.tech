A87U7LY9OKZNY,B007WTAJTO,A. Liu,"[0, 0]",Used it in my Galaxy Note 2 for the past 16 months. All the sudden it is no longer writable. I tried many ways to reformat the card. Even Windows says format successful but all files remain after I remove and re-insert the card. Since I have private files in the card I'm not able to delete.

A3LBEV0UWH9V2G,B007WTAJTO,Allen,"[0, 0]","Got this because you can't beat the price and Sandisk has so far always been reliable for me.  I own two 32gb UHS-1 cards and a few older (16gb, 8gb, class 4, class 6, etc) Sandisk MicroSDs not including my standard SDs or my USB thumb drives and they have stood up to my tests with only one card I can think of failing, which I was still able to recover all the data from (just not write to it anymore) and I'm pretty hard on my rewritable media.

A29TSPI4U7YV9M,B007WTAJTO,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Simply put the card works well in my NOTE 3, gives me the extra space needed and to date has worked flawlessly. I upgraded from a 64GB Sandisk to the 128GB with no issues. Plenty of space available now in my phone and I can keep movies and music local. Some people have scoffed online about using such a large card but the reality of it is that you don't always have data service and when that time comes, such as when you're on a plane, its nice to have access to some movies and music that you've kept on local storage.So far its worked in my NOTE 3 and SG4.",5,just the thing I needed for my NOTE 3,1398729600,2014-04-29,223,0,0,5,Thank you for your detailed review!

A2OWNOFM76M3VV,B007WTAJTO,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","The card looks good, works fine, I didn't do too much test with it.My only complaint until now is the package, there's a line marked on the back for you to cut, I cut along the line, and nothing happened, no opening at all, all cardboard glued tightly. so I cut near the card, only to found I cut the supposed plastic card case/storage shell, now I took it out, and no storage case to store. Not a functional problem, but annoying.",4,"Looks good, the package is horrible though",1355270400,2012-12-12,726,0,0,3,"Thank you for your feedback!

A3R2TY7PFN9VSM,B007WTAJTO,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","The package arrived on time, it's very well packed and it's got an adapter. It works perfectly with my phone, though it doesn't allow a computer format, once it's been on the phone, so it asks you to erase everything before you use it on a computer. So if you're planning on buying this for different purposes and devices, gotta be aware of this. I just need for my phone, so I transfer files with my usb cable, that works just right. I also give it a 3 star because it says there are 64gb, but even when it's totally formatted it only reaches to 60gb..sooo, I don't know where my other 4 gb are...anyways, overall it's working well. I do think it's expensive for what it is.",3,Almost,1375660800,2013-05-08,579,0,0,3,"Thank you for your detailed review. It's great that the card works perfectly with your phone and the adapter is useful. However, we're sorry to hear about the formatting and capacity discrepancies. The difference in storage size is due to the way manufacturers calculate gigabytes (1GB = 1 billion bytes), which can be confusing. We hope you continue to find the card useful for your phone."
AS8984CRFM1OS,B007WTAJTO,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]",There really isn't much to say about a micro SD card: it either works or it doesn't. I bought this to install in my phone and it seems to be working fine. The fit was perfect and the performance is totally satisfactory.

A2Z2ANFDUJBB9R,B007WTAJTO,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]",This card has worked flawlessly in my phone for about three months! I had an smaller and slower card in it that this replaced.

A1W8SS7X5XJAYT,B007WTAJTO,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","This is the best accessory that you can buy for your smartphone! Simple explanation:1) I loaded all my HD movies onto this micro SD card, inserted it into my Samsung Galaxy S3, and it plays them superbly without ANY delays, as it it up to 30mb/s read speed!2) The most important reason for this being the best accessory for your phone is to think about this: The premium you pay for an iPhone 64GB is $200. The price you pay for this 64GB micro SD card is $50 (depends on Amazon's pricing at the time). That means you get the same thing for $150 less, AND you can interchange your SD card between devices (if you buy a new tablet for example).No brainer.Note that it reads only at 10mb/s, so a 7GB HD movie will take about 10 - 15 minutes to load up.",5,Brilliant! Price beats iPhone's $200 price for 64GB phone by $150!,1358035200,2013-01-13,694,0,0,5,"Thank you for your detailed and enthusiastic review!
